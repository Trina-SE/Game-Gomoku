<b>Game description:</b><br>
Gomoku, also known as "five in a row", is a board game similar to tic-tac-toe but on a
larger board. It is a two-player, fully observable, deterministic, zero-sum game. Players take
turn in placing ‘stone’s in the board until one player can connect five stones of the same
color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is typically played in a 15 X 15 board,
but for this project a 10 X 10 board is sufficient. Detailed information about the game can
be found in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku
